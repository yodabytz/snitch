# snitch
Snitch is a Python tool that monitors Fail2Ban logs, detects abusive activity, and notifies netblock administrators via email. It analyzes jail-specific logs for evidence, supports custom jail configurations, logs actions to /var/log/snitch.log, and ensures professional alerts to help address potential server compromises or misuse.
